# Who am I? Why, thanks for asking! 

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with 4+ years of relevant experience. My roles in various industries have developed my leadership ability and strong communication skills. When I'm not coding I like to stay active by running, lifting, hiking, and rock climbing. I also enjoy playing guitar, cooking, DJ-ing, dancing, movies, and rooftops with friends.
