# Who am I? Why, thanks for asking! 

Full stack software engineer with over ten years experience in customer relations and customer support facing roles. My background working in customer relations has taught me that it is important to always place the customer at the center of your work, having empathy to understand the challenges and concerns facing them. As a software engineer, we create the tools that have impact on the day to day lives of our customers and I am continuously motivated by the engineering challenges that help the customer have the best possible experience.

If you'd like to stay in touch, keep an eye for my forthcoming website. It needs a bit of a refresher, 😅.

In the meanwhile, as a fan of Ruby and Java, I am always looking to learn more (cough: 🐍!). Drop by my quicklinks above if you have a fun project(s) to share. 

🌊,

Drock  ;-)
